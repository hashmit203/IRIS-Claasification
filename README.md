# IRIS-Claasification# Iris Classification Project

This project demonstrates data analysis and classification on the famous Iris dataset using Python. The notebook walks through data exploration, visualization, and the application of several machine learning models to classify iris species.

## Features
- Data loading and exploration
- Data visualization (histograms, boxplots, violin plots, pairplots)
- Outlier detection
- Correlation analysis
- Model training and evaluation using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree
- Model comparison

## Files
- `iris_classification.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook for the project
- `iris.csv`: Dataset used for analysis

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open `iris_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

The goal is to classify the samples into one of three species:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica
